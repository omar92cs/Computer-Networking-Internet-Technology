RIPv2 Routing protocol

How to run the protocol with the configuration files:
1. Extract all files to one location
2. Open terminal at location of files, or cd to location
3. Type in the command "./execute.sh"
4. Several terminals will open up each running a version of the RIPv2 protocol
(Number of terminals according to the number of configuration files)


While the program is running in the terminal, to stop the routing table from
updating on one terminal, press "CTRL + c", this will disable the program
from running for 100 seconds.

To close a router, simply close a terminal.
